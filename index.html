  <h2>Thoughts on Progessive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>When designing a webstie using graceful degradation, you design the website for specifically the best, most advanced websites. Then the older browsers are then ignored. 
Designing a webstie using progressive enchancement means starting with the most basic element of a wbesite, the content, and the adding the more compplex features, such as the
Javascript. The reason this is important is it allows users on more techinoical limted browsers to enjoy all the content websites has to offer. It also bring sthe web experiince up 
for people on worse browsers. Here is a link on further readiing: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement" target="_blank">Progressive Enhancement</a> </p>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>When I first started building this webstie, I chose to go for a space background to add without realizing how bad of an idea it was. I got feed back that it made things less readable\
and contrasted in a bad way. I ended up just puting a backgorund of the SpaceX dragon. I was also given feedback on to make my font have a margin and be a little bigger as some people will
be on the website using bigger monitors. So to accomodate for that I made the content have margins. I was told it was really easy to naviagte the webstie since the navigation stayed on the
top of the page all the time. I also was told to give the images their own space as they kind of took space from other objects in the website.</p>
<p>Throughout the semeseter, building a website with just html was really easy. As we started to use CSS, I realized how important it is to plan ahead for users and organization. One thing I
wish I had known how to use really well is sections on websites. It made the process of making a website all follow the same format. Building a website seems easy at first, but when adding
a lot of features to make your website truly unique, it gets complicated. Overall I had fun learning CSS and HTML</p>
